**Answer each of the following questions with *one sentence* including a brief explanation.**

1.  Finish the sentence with another student’s name: "If \[Name of Student\] doesn’t earn an A, then nobody should, because..." Explain your choice and your reasoning.

    Respectfully, I think this question could be reworded. As you have stated, the purpose of ungrading is to learn and grow independently, but from one another as well. The assumption is that we are trying our best given our unique circumstances, and as peers, we only know a fraction of a person's life. Regardless, everyone demonstrates their knowledge of content differently, whether that be through the code that they have not shared with peers or have verbally demonstrated their knowledge in the intuition verbally, but not efficiently in their code. It is not fair to compare one another based off of small interactions and biases we may have for or against others in the class.

    Rather, based on how I have collaborated with my peers, I believe that Sylvia deserves an A. Sylvia and I worked together outside of class, and I believe we had varying approaches to the labs, particularly lab 5 where we were given more of that freedom. When laying out how to approach the problem, the ideas she communicated helped me ultimately better understand the pipeline to get to the final suspect. The code she writes follows the tidyverse styling with properly formatted dplyr pipelines and appropriate variable names as well as proper indentations.

2.  What was the most difficult part of the class for you? List a general topic, a specific problem, a kind of work we did, etc. and explain why.\
    \
    I think the most difficult part of the class was learning the forcats package, particularly knowing when to use it since most data types can be reorganized with other functions, but using forcats, you can establish your own order to organize the data by, which is extremely useful for reordering the legend of graphs.

3.  What was the easiest part of the class for you? Explain why.

    Understanding when to use what join since I went over this topic in 2 other classes this quarter.

4.  What part of the class surprised or interested you the most? Explain why.

    I really enjoyed learning various modifications I can make to my graph to make it look nicer or add detail that would not be there by default which adds personality and can convey information more efficiently.

5.  Give one piece of advice to a student just beginning a quarter of STAT 331 that will help them be successful in learning.

    Learn how to read documentation well; ChatGPT regurgitates mediocre summaries so it's better to just go straight to the source and authors who wrote it (also just a good skill to have in computing).
